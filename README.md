My goal for this webpage is to develop a simple calendar/planner app for shceduling a work day. I am going to develop a planner with working hours from 9am-5pm. I am mainly focusing on a standard dayshift work schedule. 

I must mention that in addition to HTML, CSS and Javascript, I am also utilizing Moment.JS, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, FontAwesome and jQuery to complete this project. There are links to these different resources in the HTML file. The CSS and Javascript files are linked to HTML as well. 

The current day will be displayed a the top of the planner. When I scroll down, I will be able to see the timeblocks with the business hours. The timeblocks are color coded to represent either past(light gray), present(red), or future (green).

I also had to save the user input in the daily activity container to localStorage.
