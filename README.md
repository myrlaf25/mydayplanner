My goal for this webpage is to develop a simple calendar/planner app for shceduling a work day. I am going to develop a planner with working hours from 8am-5pm. I am mainly focusing on a standard dayshift work schedule. 

I must mention that in addition to HTML, CSS and Javascript, I am also utilizing Moment.JS, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, FontAwesome and jQuery to complete this project. There are links to these different resources in the HTML file. The CSS and Javascript files are linked to HTML as well. 

The current day will be displayed a tthe top of the planner. When I scroll down I will be able to see the timeblocks with the business hours. The timeblocks are color coded to represent either past(light gray), present(light red), or future (light teal). 




# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
